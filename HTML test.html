        <p id = "about">I was born and raised in the bay area in Santa Clara California. 
        I graduated from Cupertino High School, started College at De Anza College and transferred to San Jose State. 
        My strengths are in <strong>Java</strong> and <strong>C++</strong> primarily, and I have some experience with <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>Javascript</strong>. 
        I have completed coursework in Computer Architecture, Formal Languages and Computations, Linear Algebra, Discrete Math, Data Structures and Algorithms, and Object Oriented Programming and Design. 
        I have extensive experience using Github, which I have used to document nearly all of my projects from school projects, to personal projects, even to Codecademy projects.
        I have four years of work experience in the customer service industry while working as a lifeguard and supervisor 
        at California's Great America. I worked as a lifeguard for two and a half seasons, then midway through my third season,
         I got promoted to supervisor. Because of my time at California's Great America as a supervisor, 
        I have extensive leadership experience and know what it takes to lead a team of individuals.
